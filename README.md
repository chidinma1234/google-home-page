# Google Home Page

I created a google home page using react.js.

## COMPONENTS

I was able to create 3 major components from the google home page and these components have their sub component:

1.header component: This component houses the nav links on our page and this nav-links are also broken down into their component which are:

- MenuItems component.
- Avatar component
- Icon component

2. Main component: This component house the Google logo and the search input .This are used to create sub components which are imported into the Main component.This components include:

- GoogleLogo component.
- SearchBar component
- Buttons component
- Languages component.

3. Footer component: This is found at the end of the page.
