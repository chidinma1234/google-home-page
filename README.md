# **Google Home Page**

I created a google home page using react.js.

## **COMPONENTS**

I was able to create 3 major components from the google home page and these components have their sub component:

1.header component: This component houses the nav links on our page and this nav-links are also broken down into their component which are:

- MenuItems component.
- Avatar component

3. Footer component: This is found at the end of the page.This component is also broken down into its own sub-component.They include:
